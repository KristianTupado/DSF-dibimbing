# DSF-dibimbing: Titanic Survival Analysis

Welcome to the **Titanic Survival Analysis** project, completed as part of the Dibimbing Digital Skill Fair program. This project utilizes machine learning techniques to predict passenger survival rates based on various features.

## Project Overview
This analysis focuses on predicting the survival of Titanic passengers using historical data, with a primary goal of understanding how demographic factors, ticket class, and other features influenced survival chances.

## Key Features
- **Machine Learning Models**: We implemented and compared multiple classification models:
  - Random Forest (Best accuracy: 82%)
  - Decision Tree
  - XGBoost
  - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

**Data Exploration and Feature Engineering**: Analysis of features like age, sex, class, and fare to derive insights about survival probabilities and correlations within the data.

**Note**: The accuracy screenshot for the Random Forest model on slide 12 shows 73%, which is based on unnecessary standardized data. The actual accuracy is 82%, as confirmed by the confusion matrix. Thank you for your understanding!
